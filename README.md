## Final Project
This is the repository of the final project for Fasta & Furious. Inside are the data files we used to replicate certain analyses from the paper "_Staphylococcus aureus_ Innate Immune Evasion is Lineage-Specific: A Bioinfomatics Study" by McCarthy AJ, Lindsay JA. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134813002372?via%3Dihub
